The US economy finally showed signs that investors are waking up to reality.  After more than a month of the social and economic shutdown the largest indicator of economic health has finally shown some weakness.

When the market first started to recover after the middle of March it left many confused.  Many of us were just starting to social distance from our jobs and all too many from their paychecks.  Small businesses were shutting down and all rational thought suggested we were in for more market free fall.

Then the miraculous happened and stocks started to take off.  They never really recovered the highs from the start of the year, but half of the losses had been recovered as we roared back from 18k territory up to 24k.  And this at a time when people are locked down in their homes and the only spending is on Netflix subscriptions and Amazon goods.  Investors, however, could not be deterred from the chance to grab cheap stocks and restart the bull market with nothing more than a buy order and hope.

Apparently these investors are running out of hope and starting to read the articles about the impacts to businesses and working class people.  All that can be predicted from here is that we are in for more of a wild ride.  So, sit back, buckle up, and try not to cry in public.  It scares the kids.
