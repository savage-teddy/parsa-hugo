Pier 1 imports is finally going under.  It has taken at least a decade, but the inevitable has finally happened.  The behemoth retailer has long provided ample free parking for the valuable stores next to them.  Unfortunately this business model wasn't sustainable in the e-commerce era.

The store's brand of over priced furniture and decorations was made to look as if the owner has traveled the world.  Somehow the retailer never realized new market segments would rather **Go** on a vacation than buy a ratan couch....that looked like it came from Pier 1.  The final nail in the coffin of the retailer is likely the rise of Instagram.  Never has it been so easy to credibly pretend that you could afford to charter a jet to a pricey destination.  If you stretch your budget it is even possible to pay for gas to an [Ikea](https://www.cnet.com/news/instagram-influencer-natalia-taylor-fakes-bali-vacation-with-ikea-pics/) and fake your vacation while picking up a cheap cafeteria lunch.

The retailer has claimed the COVID was the final nail in the coffin, but to this writer it feels more like a mercy killing at this point.  Googling Pier 1 yields lots of photos of empty parking lots.
