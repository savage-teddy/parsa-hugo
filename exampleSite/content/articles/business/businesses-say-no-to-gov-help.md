![](/images/nycdebtclock.jpg)Treasury secretary Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Powell are set to be grilled today over the possibility of authorizing more funding for COVID19 relief.  Team Trump has not sounded interested in allocating more money, while the private organization that makes money off of loans to the US government was more open to the idea.

This is at a time when Senators and Congresspeople are struggling to look like they are doing stuff to help the American people.  However, a look at the very confusing docs from the [Senate](https://www.toomey.senate.gov/files/documents/COC%201st%20Report_05.18.2020.pdf) indicates that there is some trouble in spending $500B of the money.  In the haste to push the relief there were some minor problems like...the minimum size of the loan was OVER $500k, and the loan had to be because of COVID19 circumstances, etc.

What we can expect is the congress will continue to posture and bills will be passed in hopes of looking productive.  This won't help the many millions who lost a job because of Corona Virus.  If there is a bright side (even a small one), the nation may not actually go further into debt just to make ourselves feel better!...don't look [here](https://www.usdebtclock.org/)...it'll make you feel bad again.  I told you not to look.
