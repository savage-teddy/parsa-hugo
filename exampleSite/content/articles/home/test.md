After a month and a half of being at home all the time with their children, many parents are on the verge of snapping.  What started out as a fun time of bonding and quality time has become a prison sentence for some.

In recent posts on social media, opinion articles, and a thank you from Google, it has become clear that some American's weren't prepared for this much togetherness.  Parents are becoming more engaged in academics.  And if this video is any indicator, we aren't as smart as those 5th graders anymore.

Some have even given up on schooling all together.  One unnamed parent was quoted as saying, "let them watch educational TV, just let them do it in another room!"  As our noble goals of crafts, book reading, and other such creative hobbies falls away, we are left with a simple truth.  The kids will entertain themselves.  So whether you've tossed the tablet to the lions, or you just let them play in the street, they will be ok.
