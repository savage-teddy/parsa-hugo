In a strong statement last week, Hawaii confirmed their 14 day quarantine is no joke.  The state did so in strong fashion by [arresting](https://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/latest-news/hawaii-covid-19-joint-information-center-news-release-social-media-posts-lead-to-another-visitor-arrest-may-15-2020/) a tourist who had arrived and begun taking pictures on the beach the same day.  Lucky for those concerned about COVID19, big brother was watching for Instagram feeds with hashtags calling out the local scenery.  Instead of a beach vacation this tourist is spending his time cooling his heels in the local slammer.  We assume his snarky response to this would be something like, "Hawaii, come for the beach, quarantine in your hotel, or get thrown in the slammer."

So, if you want to enjoy the beaches of the Aloha State, plan on a long vacation.  14 days in a hotel room before you are allowed to hit the beaches will be sure hit to any travelers wallet.  If this doesn't fit in your budget, don't feel bad, take a virtual tour!  You'll save a ton of money, it will be way less crowded, and you won't have paid to be on an overcrowded airplane seat for 6 or more hours.
