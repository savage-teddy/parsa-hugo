Another press conference became a battleground today in the long running contest between the president and traditional media outlets.  While calling on reporters one reporter challenged the president on his usage of comparative language.  The reporter instead wanted to focus on the fact that people are dying.

The president then redirected the focus on why people are dying to China.  The reporter then tried to spin this question back at the president as if he were personally attacking the reporter.

At this point the president tried disengagement instead of a head on battle with a press corp hungry for blood and smelling some in the water.  Despite his attempts to move the press conference along the other reporters waited patiently to see if their colleague could draw blood.

Sensing that the crowd was going to shift the focus of the session, the president yielded the battlefield.  It's tough to say whether he gave up because it wasn't going his way, or if he was being a better person by not arguing with someone who was out to get him.  What we do know is that those who hate him will take it their way, and those who love him will keep supporting him.  Watch the 1:31 video and see which fits your narrative.
