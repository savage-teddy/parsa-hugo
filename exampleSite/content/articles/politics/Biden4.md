Amid the coronovirus stay at home order, professional gamers have noticed something, nay someone, lurking on the interweb. Joe Biden has been spotted tearing it up on EA's famous first person shooter game Battlefield 4.

Biden trolls under the alias of **'Obama08'**. His gameplay mimics that of what professionals call 'camping', in which a player nestles into a secluded corner waiting for the virtual kill. Bidens weapon of choice, cursing, although he does believe in the other team using guns.

Players often like to chit chat with him about his tactics on the field (i.e. Battlefield). Once, Biden was heard over the comms stating, 
> Well, you know, my shotgun will do better for you than your AR-15, because you want to keep someone away from your house, just fire the shotgun through the door.

If your a Battlefield 4 fan, look for ol' Joe on the field and get sum!
