On Monday it became public knowledge that the president is taking hydroxychloroquine.  This became immediate political fodder for those wanting to ridicule the president as an early study published by the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2012410) showed no clear positive or negative benefits across an ethnically and age diverse population.  The study however didn't look at subpopulations or have controls for numerous other issues due to the urgency of the situation. 

What has confounded the situation is that studies by the [French](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32205204) and [Chinese](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v3) have shown positive results in patients who took the medicine.  Those trials were smaller in the number of patients observed and the patients were likely less diverse than those studied in NYC.

What is most shocking is that this shows Trump is willing to listen to foreigners.  He may build a wall to keep them out, but he'll at least accept their medical results when published on the internet.  Remember 1 out of 5 doctors doesn't agree with 4 out of 5 doctors!
