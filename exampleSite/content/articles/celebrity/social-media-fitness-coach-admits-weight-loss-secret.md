Everyone loves to stay fit and trim, especially in this social media driven age. With one quick look on any social media site and you'll find oodles of stereotypical gym rates that obsess about every calorie or protein molecule. Well we finally interviewed one of them to determine their secret on how they stay so fit and trim.

The source requested to stay anonymous, but stated they speak for all social media fitness coaches world wide. Here's the secret in their own words...

>Everyday we wake up and go straight to every social media site we post to, to see how many likes and comments we have. This process can take upwards of 4 hours, and you'll see why in a second. After that we all go for that intense 30 minute work out, and let me tell you it's a real high if you had over 10,000+ likes for a photo... but that's not where the real fitness and toning happens. The real fitness and toning happens during the next 8 hours, where my fingers are frantically moving. That's right, frantically moving fingers is the secret, and the best way to do that is with posting at least 500 times a day. With every post, we always include a picture of ourselves posing like were doing some really intense workout, but not before we touch up the colors in the picture. I personal use a open source color touch software product 'Your face, Celebrity body'. It seems to produce the best color contrasts. So there you have it, the secret is in frantically typing 500 social media posts a day... gotta run, posts are awaiting.
