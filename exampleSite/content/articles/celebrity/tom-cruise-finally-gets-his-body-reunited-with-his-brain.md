description = "NASA and SpaceX are teaming up to finally get Tom Cruise off this rock.  The two organizations are working hard to get Tom into space to disprove the existance of Thetans and the planet Xenu.  While in orbit Tom will shoot a movie, the details of which are somewhere between slim and none at the time of this writing.  Unfortunately the filming of this movie is not likely to change Tom's mind, but will lend credence to the moon landing was faked consipracy.  Either way the movie is sure to fun with lots of CGI and maybe some nice fake explosions."
