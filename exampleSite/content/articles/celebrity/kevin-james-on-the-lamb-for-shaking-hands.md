Actor Kevin James went on the lamb today after he was caught breaking social distancing rules.  Surprisingly, even for his physique, Mr. James was able to elude capture for 6 whole hours before being captured by the search team.  Live video of the chase and incident was captured and posted on the internet for all the world to see.

We didn't attempt to contact Mr. James for comment since he is likely covered in Corona Virus and we don't want to get sick.  A best guess is that his publicist is happy that he got publicity and only talking to him via phone or email.

This is a serious and sober reminder that all Americans should be alert for rule breakers.  Remember, see something, say something and we'll all be safer together...but still 6 feet apart.
